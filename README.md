# Product Analytics
This repository contains my efforts to compile and organize the knowledge and insights gained from studying under Data Analytics expert Anatoly Karpov. The materials cover important topics such as customer segmentation, product metrics, presentation of research results, prioritization, and product economics. I hope that it may be of use to product analysts, marketing professionals, or anyone interested in the field.

# Metrics Does a Product Analyst Monitor

There are metrics that are crucial for analyzing a product, which focuses on both user behavior and money. These indicators must be tracked and analyzed to ensure the health of the product.

## MAU (Active Monthly Audience) 
The number of users who were active at least once a month and engaged with the product.

## DAU (Active Daily Audience) 
For everyday products such as trackers or social networks.

## MNU (Monthly New Users) 
The number of new users per month, along with the money they bring in, their contribution to profits, and turnover.

## Utilization (Conversion to User) 
The number of users who started using the product after a successful onboarding, purchase, or subscription.

## Frequency (Frequency of Use) 
The average number of active actions taken in the product.

## MCU (Monthly Churned Users) 
The number of users who have permanently left the product. It's important to define the criteria for identifying these users. For mature projects, the MCU should equal the number of new users per month.

## Churn Rate (User Churn Rate) 
A high churn rate (more than 5-7%) is a bad sign for the product.
